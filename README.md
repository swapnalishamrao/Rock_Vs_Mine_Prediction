# Rock_Vs_Mine_Prediction
1. Business Problem.
2. Solution Strategy
My strategy to solve this challenge was:

Step 01: Data Description: Use statistics metrics to identify data distribuctions.

Step 02: Feature Engineering: Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.

Step 03: Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

Step 04: Feature Selection: Selection of the most significant attributes for training the model.

Step 05: Machine Learning Modelling: Machine Learning model training.

Step 06: Hyperparameter Fine Tunning: hoose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected from the previous step.

Step 07: Convert Model Performance to Business Values: Convert the performance of the Machine Learning model into a business result.

Step 08: Deploy Modelo to Production: Publish the model in a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision.
